# Shiny Weather App  

This app provides weather data for a few major cities. It's mostly a proof-of-concept, because free-tier Shiny hosting and OpenWeatherMaps can't support heavy usage.  

To run this app:  
* get your own [OpenWeatherMaps API key](https://openweathermap.org/price)  
* put it in a file called **api_key.txt** in the **data** folder  

# Thanks  

Thanks to these two organizations:  
* [OpenWeatherMaps](https://openweathermap.org), for their generous free-tier API  
* [SimpleMaps](https://simplemaps.com), for their generously licensed (CC 4.0) list of city names and coordinates
